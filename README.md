# AmazingHand (a.k.a AH!) Project

[![Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/U0TfeG3ZUto/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0TfeG3ZUto)


# Amazing Hand project
Amazing Hand is a low-cost (<200â‚¬) and open-source 4 fingers hand, driven by parallel actuation.
[docs/AmazingHand_Overview.pdf]
Small Feetech SCS0009 servos are used to move each finger in flexion / extension, & Abduction / Adduction
![Finger Overview](assets/Finger_Overview.jpg)

2 ways of control are available :
- Use a Serial bus driver (waveshare i.e.) + Python script
- Use an arduino + feetech TTL Linker
Detailed explaination are available for both and Basic demo software is available also. Up to you !

# Build Resources
## BOM (Bill Of Materials)
The list of all needed components is available here:  
[AmazingHand BOM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QH2ePseqXjAhkWdS9oBYAcHPrxaxkSRCgM_kOK0m52E/edit?gid=1269903342#gid=1269903342)  
![BOM](assets/BOM.jpg)
+ Control choice (2 options detailed previously)

## STL Files and Onshape document
STL and Steps files can be found [here](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/AmazingHand/tree/main/cad)  

Everyone can access the Onshape document too:   
[Link Onshape](To be Updated)  
![AmazingHand onshape picture](To be Updated)  

Note that predefined position are available in "named position" tooling, with corresponding servos angles

## Assembly Guide
Here is guide to explain how to print all the needed custom parts :
[=> 3D Printing Guide](/docs/AmazingHand_3DprintingTips.pdf)
![3DPrint_example](/assets/3DPrint.jpg) 

And then how to use them to build the Amazing Hand in combination with standards components in the BOM.
